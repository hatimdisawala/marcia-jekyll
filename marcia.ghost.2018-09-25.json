Like \n{{author.name}}, for example, outputs the name of the current author.\n\nThe best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at \nthe\nsource code for Casper [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper], which is heavily\ncommented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.\n\n * default.hbs  is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this\n   file unless specifically told to use a different template.\n * post.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing a post.\n * index.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.\n * and so on\n\nWe've got full and extensive theme documentation\n[http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about]  which outlines every template file,\ncontext and helper that you can use.\n\nIf you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or\nhelp, there's also a #themes  channel in our public Slack community\n[https://slack.ghost.org]  which we always recommend joining!","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/design.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2017-09-01T05:26:22.000Z","created_by":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","updated_at":"2018-09-05T13:07:16.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-09-01T05:26:22.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"59a8ef7eff12137a359489ea","uuid":"e5d44053-8736-4aab-8ee0-a5cf39734f25","title":"Advanced Markdown tips","slug":"advanced-markdown","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Ghost editor\\n\\nIf you've gotten pretty comfortable with [all the basics](/the-editor/) of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!\\n\\nAs with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.\\n\\n\\n## Special formatting\\n\\nAs well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:\\n\\n+ ~~strike through~~\\n+ ==highlight==\\n+ \\\\*escaped characters\\\\*\\n\\n\\n## Writing code blocks\\n\\nThere are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block.

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging\nposts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of\nrelated content.\n\nBasic tagging\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between\ncategories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with News  and\nother posts with Cycling, which would create two distinct categories of content\nlisted on /tag/news/  and /tag/cycling/, respectively.\n\nIf you tag a post with both News  and  Cycling  - then it appears in both\nsections.\n\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you\nhave. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own\ncover images and meta data.\n\nThe primary tag\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The\nfirst tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will\nonly display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can\nadd the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add\na bunch of related tags which are less important.\n\nNews, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports\n\nIn this example, News  is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme,\nbut the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their\nrespective archives.\n\nPrivate tags\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't\nnecessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In\nGhost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\n\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want\nyour theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more\nspace for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\nNews, Cycling, #video\n\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and \nCycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with\n #video.\n\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them\nspecial formatting:\n\n{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=\"#video\"}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n\n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation [https://themes.ghost.org/].","feature_image":"https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/tags.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2017-09-01T05:26:22.000Z","created_by":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","updated_at":"2018-09-05T13:08:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-09-01T05:26:26.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"59a8ef7eff12137a359489ee","uuid":"90c86a08-db36-4d4f-ae6c-6ac67e3d04b6","title":"Using the Ghost editor","slug":"the-editor","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Ghost uses a language called **Markdown** to format text.\\n\\nWhen you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document.

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.\\n\\n\\n## Basic tagging\\n\\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/tag/news/` and `/tag/cycling/`, respectively.\\n\\nIf you tag a post with both `News` *and* `Cycling` - then it appears in both sections.\\n\\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have.

In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\\n\\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen.

In this case, you could use\nprivate tags to tell your theme what to do.\n\nNews, Cycling, #video\n\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and \nCycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with\n #video.\n\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them\nspecial formatting:\n\n{{#post}}\n    {{#has tag=\"#video\"}}\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\n    {{else}}\n        ...regular markup for a post...\n    {{/has}}\n{{/post}}\n\n\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many\nmore over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation [https://themes.ghost.org/].","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/11/pexels-photo-69100-1.jpeg","featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-10-02T17:17:46.000Z","created_by":"5b90c8a451e3cc2e59a33b56","updated_at":"2018-03-20T09:22:36.000Z","updated_by":"5b90c8a451e3cc2e59a33b56","published_at":"2017-10-18T17:17:00.000Z","published_by":"5b90c8a451e3cc2e59a33b56","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"<script>\nvar sidebar_position = 'left';\n</script>","codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b90c8a551e3cc2e59a33b7b","uuid":"155dcb90-96a9-4bb4-aa52-46cf4d683326","title":"Looking at Your Newborn: What's Normal","slug":"looking-at-your-newborn-whats-normal","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Ghost uses a language called **Markdown** to format text.\\n\\nWhen you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document.
